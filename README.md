# DeepLearning_lib

**DeepLearning_lib** is a Python library with data_io, image procesing, and neural networks based on tensorflow and/or keras frameworks


**The main features** of this library are:


1. High level API, all folders include base class and derived classes except the utils folder
2. Multiple models for tensorflow and keras are included seperately
3. Helpful losses and metircs functions for tensorflow
  (if you are using keras, you need to derive losses and metrics function from keras libs by yourself)
4. Helpful functions like image processing and visualization tools (will add more)


**update 11/28/2019**


* Unet3D model for segmentation has been updated to the libs
* Some part of codes are heavily borrowed from https://github.com/ellisdg/3DUnetCNN
